        <h2>Achievements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Achievement 1: Kajal, an eighteen year old student hails from a financially weak family. Her father is a rickshaw puller in Delhi and her mother, a domestic cook. After completing her 10th Standard, she joined a one-year software training programme. 
                <ul></ul>
                The training helped her to learn coding in Node.js, Python, and Javascript and improved her communication skills and personality. Within 5 months of her training, she got hired by MindTree.
                <ul></ul>
                 Now, she is a proud Software Engineer who is helping her family financially. 
                 <ul></ul>
                Thatâ€™s the impact of holistic learning at NavGurukul.</li>
                <ul>
                    
                </ul>
            <li>Achievement 2: Hear from the alumnus
                <ul></ul>
                NavGurukul transformed my life. Coming from a humble background, I was determined to break free from an unhealthy environment and support my family.
                <ul></ul>
                 At NavGurukul, I learned Python and JavaScript, embraced peer learning, and secured an internship with NatWest within four months. 
                 <ul></ul>
                 Today, I work at an MNC, earning more than my family's combined income. 
                 <ul></ul>
                 Beyond financial gains, NavGurukul's greatest impact is the social change it inspires, encouraging girls like me to pursue their dreams and make a difference.
